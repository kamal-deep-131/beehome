# Behome

Behome is a beautiful, UI-focused web application built with React, Firebase, and Vite. It showcases my ability to create modern and responsive designs using Tailwind CSS and demonstrates core functionality like authentication, profile management, and API integration.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Supports email/password and Google sign-in using Firebase.
- **Password Management**: Allows users to reset their password using Firebase's built-in password reset functionality.
- **Profile Management**: Users can view and manage their profiles.
- **State Management**: Uses React Context for state uplifting and management across components.
- **Routing**: Implemented with React Router DOM for seamless navigation.
- **Axios for API**: Axios is used to fetch data from external APIs.
- **Toast Notifications**: Provides feedback and improves UX by using toast notifications.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Front-end JavaScript framework for building interactive UIs.
- **Firebase**: Backend as a Service (BaaS) used for authentication and user management.
- **Vite**: Front-end tooling for faster and leaner development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for building responsive, modern designs.

};
```

5. **Run the app locally**
After setting up Firebase configuration, start the app:

If you are using NPM:
``` bash 
npm run dev
```

If you are using Yarn:
``` bash 
yarn dev
```

If you are using bun:
``` bash 
bun run dev
```

The app will run on http://localhost:5173.
